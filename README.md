# Customer Churn Analysis with Python (Pandas)

##  Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn using **Python and pandas**. The goal is to explore patterns in customer behavior, identify key factors contributing to churn, and provide insights that could help businesses retain customers.  

Instead of using complex machine learning models, I kept it simple and effectiveâ€”leveraging only **pandas** to clean, process, and analyze the data. This project is a great way to demonstrate my ability to work with real-world datasets and extract meaningful insights using Python.

## Case Study  

### **Problem Statement**  
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses. A high churn rate means losing customers, which impacts revenue and growth. The objective of this analysis is to:  
- Identify key trends in customer churn  
- Understand how factors like tenure, contract type, and monthly charges influence churn  
- Provide actionable insights for reducing churn

## **Data & Methodology**  

### ðŸ“‚ **Dataset**  
I used a **Telco Customer Churn** dataset containing **7,032 records** and **21 columns**, including customer demographics, subscription details, and churn status.

###  **Steps Performed**  

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values in the `TotalCharges` column  
   - Converted data types where necessary  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Calculated key metrics such as churn rate, average tenure, and customer distribution  
   - Identified trends in churn based on customer demographics and subscription details  

3. **Key Insights**  
   - Customers with **month-to-month contracts** had the highest churn rate  
   - Higher **monthly charges** were linked to a higher likelihood of churn  
   - Customers with **fiber optic internet** churned more than those using DSL

##  **Findings & Business Recommendations**  

 **Focus on Retaining Month-to-Month Customers**  
- Offer discounts or long-term contract incentives to reduce churn  

  **Improve Customer Experience for Fiber Optic Users**  
- Investigate if service issues are driving churn and enhance support  

 **Analyze High Monthly Charge Customers**  
- Provide personalized retention offers for customers paying higher fees

##  **Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (pandas, numpy)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  


## ðŸ“Œ **Conclusion**  
This project highlights how **pandas** alone can be a powerful tool for data analysis. By analyzing customer churn, I demonstrated my ability to clean data, uncover insights, and provide actionable business recommendationsâ€”all using **Python**.
